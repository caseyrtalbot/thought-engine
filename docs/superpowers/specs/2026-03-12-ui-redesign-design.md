# Thought Engine UI Redesign: Design Specification

**Date**: 2026-03-12
**Status**: V3 (incorporates deep architectural review)
**Project**: `/Users/caseytalbot/Projects/thought-engine/`

## Product Vision

Thought Engine is a visual IDE for structured thinking where the "compiler" is an LLM agent and the "code" is interconnected markdown documents. Three co-equal surfaces drive the core interaction loop:

- **Graph** (center): The knowledge navigator. Shows topology, clustering, and gaps so the user can direct the agent's next move. Primary navigation paradigm. The graph is alive: nodes appear in real-time as the agent writes files.
- **Terminal** (right): The agent interaction surface. Claude Code running inside the app. Not a convenience panel, but the core of the workflow.
- **File tree** (left): The agent's output. Structured markdown artifacts organized in a hierarchical vault on the local filesystem.

**The loop**: Orient (graph) > Inspect (editor) > Direct (terminal/agent) > Observe (new nodes appear) > Reorient (graph).

Relationships between ideas are the primary object. Documents are substrate that generates the graph.

**Offline guarantee**: The graph, editor, and file tree are zero-dependency on network. All data is local filesystem. If the Claude API is unreachable, the terminal surfaces connection state but the rest of the app remains fully functional.

## Approach

**Hybrid: Foundation Then Function.** Four phases, each a complete horizontal slice that leaves the app in a working, improved state.

| Phase | Name | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | Foundation | IPC security, custom titlebar, layout skeleton, session persistence, error boundaries, command palette |
| 2 | Function | Filesystem tree, graph controls, terminal tabs, settings |
| 3 | Interaction | Neon highlights, physics sliders, real-time graph, Graph/Skills toggle, graph minimap |
| 4 | Polish | Theme coherence, transitions, typography, editor toolbar, backlinks, status bar |

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Persistence Strategy

**No localStorage.** All Zustand stores that persist use `electron-store` (main process) or a JSON file in the vault's `.thought-engine/` directory, accessed via IPC. This survives cache clears, is portable with the vault (critical for users who sync across machines), and doesn't break on multi-window if we ever go there.

- **App-level settings** (appearance, editor, terminal preferences): `~/.thought-engine/settings.json` via electron-store
- **Vault-level settings** (graph force values, filter toggles, collapse state): `<vault>/.thought-engine/config.json` via IPC
- **Session state**: `<vault>/.thought-engine/state.json` via existing `vault:read-state` / `vault:write-state` IPC (see Session Persistence below)

New IPC handlers: `config:read`, `config:write`, `config:watch` (generic key-value, scoped to app or vault). Zustand persist middleware replaced with a custom storage adapter that calls these IPC handlers.

### Session Persistence

On crash or quit, the app must restore to previous state. Phase 1 extends the existing `VaultState` (persisted to `<vault>/.thought-engine/state.json`) to capture:

- Panel sizes (sidebar width, terminal width)
- Content view state (graph/editor/skills + which file was open)
- Graph viewport (zoom level, pan position via D3 transform)
- Terminal session IDs and scroll positions
- File tree collapse state
- Selected/hovered node ID

**Relationship to existing `VaultState`**: the existing `VaultState` type in `src/shared/types.ts` already tracks `panelLayout` (sidebarWidth, terminalWidth), `lastOpenNote`, and `idCounters`. The workspace.json file is NOT a second persistence mechanism. Instead, `VaultState` is extended with the additional fields listed above, and the existing `vault:read-state` / `vault:write-state` IPC handlers continue to read/write `<vault>/.thought-engine/state.json`. No new `workspace.json` file is created. The type extension happens in `src/shared/types.ts`.

**Save strategy**: debounced write on state change (500ms debounce). On app launch, read state.json via `vault:read-state` and hydrate all stores before first render. On missing/corrupt file, fall back to defaults (no crash).

### Error Boundaries

Each panel gets its own React error boundary with a graceful fallback. A Canvas2D crash in the graph should not white-screen the entire app.

- `PanelErrorBoundary` wrapper component: catches render errors, shows "Something went wrong" with a retry button and error details expandable
- Wrapped around: Sidebar, ContentArea (graph/editor/skills), TerminalPanel
- Titlebar and StatusBar are simple enough to not need boundaries
- Errors logged to `<vault>/.thought-engine/error.log` for debugging

### File Size Constraint

Single responsibility per file, not an arbitrary line count. If a file does one thing well and is easy to understand, it can be as long as it needs to be. GraphRenderer.ts with glow, dimming, edge brightening, labels, hover state, and selection rings will naturally be large. That's fine as long as its single responsibility (rendering the graph to canvas) is clear and it doesn't take on unrelated concerns.

### Destructive Action Safety

No app-level undo/redo system in V1, but all destructive operations (file delete, folder delete) require confirmation dialogs. File rename is inline and reversible (Escape cancels). Graph node delete is really file delete, so it goes through the same confirmation path.

Future consideration: command pattern for app-level undo.

### IPC Security Model

The current preload (`src/preload/index.ts`) exposes the full `electronAPI` from `@electron-toolkit/preload` with no channel allowlist. Any renderer code can invoke any IPC channel. This is a security gap that must be closed in Phase 1.

**Phase 1 requirement**: replace the blanket `electronAPI` exposure with a typed channel allowlist. Channel names must match the actual registered handlers in `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts`:

```typescript
// src/preload/index.ts — Phase 1 replacement
const api = {
  window: {
    minimize: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('window:minimize'),
    maximize: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('window:maximize'),
    close: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('window:close'),
  },
  config: {
    read: (scope: string, key: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('config:read', scope, key),
    write: (scope: string, key: string, value: unknown) => ipcRenderer.invoke('config:write', scope, key, value),
  },
  fs: {
    readFile: (path: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('fs:read-file', { path }),
    writeFile: (path: string, content: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('fs:write-file', { path, content }),
    listFiles: (dir: string, pattern?: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('fs:list-files', { dir, pattern }),
    listFilesRecursive: (dir: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('fs:list-files-recursive', { dir }),
    deleteFile: (path: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('fs:delete-file', { path }),
    selectVault: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('fs:select-vault'),
  },
  vault: {
    init: (vaultPath: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('vault:init', { vaultPath }),
    readConfig: (vaultPath: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('vault:read-config', { vaultPath }),
    writeConfig: (vaultPath: string, config: VaultConfig) => ipcRenderer.invoke('vault:write-config', { vaultPath, config }),
    readState: (vaultPath: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('vault:read-state', { vaultPath }),
    writeState: (vaultPath: string, state: VaultState) => ipcRenderer.invoke('vault:write-state', { vaultPath, state }),
    gitBranch: (vaultPath: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('vault:git-branch', { vaultPath }),
    watchStart: (vaultPath: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('vault:watch-start', { vaultPath }),
    watchStop: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('vault:watch-stop'),
  },
  terminal: {
    create: (cwd: string, shell?: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('terminal:create', { cwd, shell }),
    write: (sessionId: string, data: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('terminal:write', { sessionId, data }),
    resize: (sessionId: string, cols: number, rows: number) => ipcRenderer.invoke('terminal:resize', { sessionId, cols, rows }),
    kill: (sessionId: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('terminal:kill', { sessionId }),
    getProcessName: (sessionId: string) => ipcRenderer.invoke('terminal:process-name', { sessionId }),
  },
  on: {
    terminalData: (callback: (data: { sessionId: string; data: string }) => void) =>
      ipcRenderer.on('terminal:data', (_e, data) => callback(data)),
    terminalExit: (callback: (data: { sessionId: string; code: number }) => void) =>
      ipcRenderer.on('terminal:exit', (_e, data) => callback(data)),
    fileChanged: (callback: (data: { path: string; event: 'add' | 'change' | 'unlink' }) => void) =>
      ipcRenderer.on('vault:file-changed', (_e, data) => callback(data)),
  },
}
```

The existing `vault:read-config`, `vault:write-config`, `vault:read-state`, `vault:write-state` handlers are preserved as-is (they read/write typed JSON files). The new `config:read` / `config:write` handlers (Phase 1C) provide a generic key-value interface for the new settings and workspace persistence, layered alongside the existing typed vault config.

New handler `terminal:process-name` must be registered in `src/main/ipc/shell.ts`. Implementation: `ShellService` gets a `getProcessName(sessionId: string): string | null` method that returns `session.process` from the `IPty` instance (node-pty exposes this as the `process` property).

Only channels in this allowlist are callable from the renderer. The existing `window.electron.ipcRenderer` global is removed. All renderer code migrates to `window.api.<domain>.<method>()`.

**Key migration targets** (files that currently call `window.electron.ipcRenderer` directly):
- `src/renderer/src/store/vault-store.ts` (line 5: `const ipcRenderer = window.electron.ipcRenderer`)
- `src/renderer/src/panels/terminal/TerminalPanel.tsx` (terminal IPC calls)
- `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` (`vault:git-branch` call)

This is a breaking change to all existing IPC call sites, so it must be done as the first task in Phase 1 before any other IPC work builds on the old pattern.

### Chokidar Watcher Hardening

The current `VaultWatcher` (`src/main/services/vault-watcher.ts`) only ignores dotfiles (`/(^|[/\\])\../`) and `node_modules`. On large vaults this will fire on build artifacts, vendor directories, and other noise.

**Phase 1 addition**: extend the watcher with configurable ignore patterns:

- Default ignores: dotfiles, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.thought-engine` (own config dir)
- Vault-level configurable ignores: read from `<vault>/.thought-engine/config.json` under key `watcher.ignorePatterns` (array of glob strings, same syntax as `.gitignore`)
- Changes to ignore patterns require watcher restart (not hot-reloaded, acceptable for a settings change)

### Edge Data Model

All relationship data comes from YAML frontmatter fields in each `.md` file. The parser (`src/renderer/src/engine/parser.ts`) extracts four relationship arrays:

| Frontmatter field | RelationshipKind | Directionality | Edge dedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| `connections` | `connection` | Non-directional | Sorted pair key |
| `clusters_with` | `cluster` | Non-directional | Sorted pair key |
| `tensions_with` | `tension` | Non-directional | Sorted pair key |
| `appears_in` | `appears_in` | Directional (source appears in target) | Ordered pair key |

**No wiki-link parsing.** The body content is not scanned for `[[target]]` links. All edges are explicit frontmatter declarations. This is a deliberate design choice: explicit relationships are higher signal than implicit text references. Wiki-link parsing may be added as a future enhancement (separate edge kind, visually distinguished), but is out of scope for this spec.

Ghost nodes are created for any frontmatter reference pointing to an `id` not found in the vault (dangling references). These render as dimmer, smaller nodes in the graph.

### Zustand Store Discipline

Four existing stores (`vault-store`, `editor-store`, `graph-store`, `terminal-store`) plus two new ones (`graph-settings-store`, `settings-store`). Rules for cross-store interaction:

1. **No store subscribes to another store.** If Component A needs data from store X and store Y, Component A selects from both stores independently. No store imports or subscribes to another store's state.
2. **Selector granularity**: always select the narrowest slice needed. `useGraphStore(s => s.contentView)` not `useGraphStore()`. This prevents re-renders when unrelated state changes.
3. **Derived data in components or hooks, not stores.** The adjacency list for hover highlighting lives in `useGraphHighlight.ts` (a hook), not in `graph-store`. Stores hold raw state; hooks and components compute derived state.
4. **Actions that span stores go through event handlers in components**, not through store-to-store coupling. Example: double-clicking a graph node updates `graph-store.contentView` to `'editor'` AND `editor-store.activeFile` to the clicked file. The `GraphPanel` click handler calls both actions, not a single action that reaches into both stores.

### Testing Strategy

Not a test plan for every component, but a targeted strategy for the units that are hardest to debug when broken:

| Unit | Test type | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `buildFileTree.ts` (Phase 2A) | Unit | Flat-to-tree path conversion has edge cases (empty dirs, deeply nested, duplicate names). Pure function, easy to test. |
| `useGraphHighlight.ts` (Phase 3A) | Unit | Adjacency list construction + connected set computation. State machine transitions (idle/hover/click/deselect). Pure logic extracted from hook for testing. |
| Graph diff logic in `useGraphAnimation.ts` (Phase 3B) | Unit | Add/remove/rename detection by file path. Rename = remove+add with same content hash. Batching accumulation. |
| `config-storage.ts` (Phase 1) | Integration | IPC round-trip: write config value, read it back. Ensures the Zustand storage adapter works with the IPC config handlers. |
| IPC channel allowlist (Phase 1) | Integration | Verify that channels NOT in the allowlist are rejected. Verify all listed channels resolve. |

Existing 35 tests must pass throughout all phases. New test files follow existing `vitest` patterns.

### State Versioning

The persistence files (`state.json`, `config.json`, `settings.json`) will evolve across versions. Each file includes a `version` field (integer, starting at 1). On read, the app checks the version and runs migration functions if the stored version is behind the current expected version.

```typescript
// Migration registry pattern
const migrations: Record<number, (state: unknown) => unknown> = {
  1: (s) => s, // V1 is baseline, no migration needed
  2: (s) => ({ ...s, newField: defaultValue }), // V1 -> V2
}
```

If the version is missing (pre-versioning file), treat as version 0 and run all migrations. If the version is higher than expected (user downgraded), load as-is with a console warning (don't crash, don't drop data).

### Multi-Vault Architectural Direction

V1 is single-vault. But the architecture must not make multi-vault painful to add later. Constraints:

- All vault-level state (files, graph, config) lives in stores that accept a vault path parameter, not singletons that assume one global vault
- The titlebar already shows a single vault tab. Multi-vault means multiple tabs, each switching the vault context for the stores below
- Per-vault stores, not a single store with vault partitions. When switching vaults, the old vault's stores are preserved in memory (or serialized) and the new vault's stores are activated
- The watcher already accepts `vaultPath` as a parameter. Multi-vault = multiple watcher instances

No multi-vault code ships in V1. This section documents the constraints so V1 doesn't accidentally paint us into a corner.

### File Conflict Resolution

When the terminal agent writes to a file the user has open in the editor:

1. The chokidar watcher fires a `change` event
2. `vault-store` updates the file content
3. If `editor-store.activeFile` matches the changed file:
   - If the editor has **no unsaved changes**: silently reload the editor content from the updated vault-store data
   - If the editor has **unsaved changes**: show a non-modal notification bar at the top of the editor: "This file was modified externally. [Reload] [Keep my changes]"
   - "Reload" discards editor state and loads the new content
   - "Keep my changes" dismisses the notification; the user's version wins until they save (at which point their version overwrites the agent's)

This is the minimum viable conflict resolution. No merge, no diff view. The notification is the key, so the user knows something changed.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### 1A: IPC Security Lockdown

**Must be the first task in Phase 1.** All subsequent phases build on the new IPC pattern.

Replace the blanket `electronAPI` exposure in `src/preload/index.ts` with the typed channel allowlist defined in the IPC Security Model cross-cutting section. Migrate all existing renderer IPC call sites from `window.electron.ipcRenderer.invoke(...)` to `window.api.<domain>.<method>(...)`.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Modify | `src/preload/index.ts` (replace blanket electronAPI with typed allowlist) |
| Create | `src/preload/api.d.ts` (TypeScript declarations for `window.api`) |
| Modify | All renderer files using `window.electron.ipcRenderer.*` (migrate to `window.api.*`) |

### 1B: Chokidar Watcher Hardening

Extend `VaultWatcher` with configurable ignore patterns as defined in the Chokidar Watcher Hardening cross-cutting section.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Modify | `src/main/services/vault-watcher.ts` (configurable ignores, expanded defaults) |

### 1C: Custom Titlebar

Replace the OS-native window chrome with a custom titlebar component.

**Electron main process changes** (`src/main/index.ts`):
- `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` on BrowserWindow config
- `trafficLightPosition: { x: 12, y: 12 }` for macOS traffic light inset
- `titleBarOverlay` config for Windows compatibility
- New IPC handlers: `window:minimize`, `window:maximize`, `window:close` (called via new `window.api.window.*` pattern from 1A)
- New IPC handlers for persistence: `config:read`, `config:write` (reads/writes JSON files)

**New component: `Titlebar.tsx`**
- Height: 38px
- macOS traffic lights occupy the left ~70px (OS-rendered, not custom)
- `-webkit-app-region: drag` on the entire titlebar for window movement
- Vault tab: single tab showing current vault name with accent dot, close button (non-functional in V1, visual only)
- Settings gear icon at far right, opens SettingsModal
- All clickable elements inside the drag region get `-webkit-app-region: no-drag`

### 1D: Layout Structure

```
App (h-screen w-screen, flex column)
├── Titlebar (38px, flex-shrink-0)
├── PanelErrorBoundary
│   └── SplitPane (flex-1, overflow-hidden)
│       ├── PanelErrorBoundary > Sidebar (240px default, resizable)
│       ├── PanelErrorBoundary > ContentArea (flex-1)
│       │   ├── GraphControls (overlay toggle)
│       │   └── GraphPanel | EditorPanel | SkillsPanel (switched via graph-store.contentView)
│       └── PanelErrorBoundary > TerminalPanel (400px default, resizable)
├── StatusBar (24px, flex-shrink-0)
└── CommandPalette (overlay)
    SettingsModal (overlay)
```

The `ContentArea` renders one of three panels based on `graph-store.contentView` (`'graph' | 'editor' | 'skills'`). The editor remains a valid content view throughout all phases. In Phase 3C the pill toggle changes to Graph/Skills, but the editor is still reachable via double-click (graph) or file selection (sidebar). The `contentView === 'editor'` rendering path is never removed.

The existing `SplitPane` component handles resizable dividers. The viewport is now: titlebar (38px) + panels (flex) + status bar (24px). Terminal default is 400px (320px is too narrow for meaningful CLI output with typical 80-column formatting).

**What stays the same**: all panel internals, all four Zustand stores (internal logic unchanged, persistence adapter swapped), all IPC handlers, existing tests.

### 1E: Command Palette

Promoted from Phase 2 because it becomes the primary navigation tool. Users need fast file/command access from day one, not after the filesystem tree lands.

**Modes**:
- **Default**: fuzzy search across file names, recent files (top 5, sorted by last opened), and runnable commands
- **File search**: type to fuzzy-match file names. Enter opens in editor. Results show folder path and artifact type dot.
- **Command search**: prefix with `>` to filter to commands only (like VS Code). Commands: toggle graph/editor, toggle sidebar, toggle terminal, new note, open settings, re-index vault, zoom to fit graph.
- **Future**: `/` prefix for slash-commands that pipe to the terminal agent (not implemented in V1, but the prefix routing architecture should support it)

**Behavior**:
- `Cmd+K` opens, `Escape` closes
- Most recent files shown immediately on open (before typing)
- Fuzzy matching with highlighted match characters
- Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select
- Palette dismisses on selection

### 1F: Files (Phase 1 Total)

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Modify | `src/preload/index.ts` (typed channel allowlist) |
| Create | `src/preload/api.d.ts` (TypeScript declarations for `window.api`) |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/components/Titlebar.tsx` |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` (stub) |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/components/PanelErrorBoundary.tsx` |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/lib/config-storage.ts` (IPC-backed Zustand storage adapter, with version migration support) |
| Create | `src/main/ipc/config.ts` (config:read, config:write handlers) |
| Modify | `src/main/index.ts` (BrowserWindow config, register config IPC, workspace restore) |
| Modify | `src/main/services/vault-watcher.ts` (configurable ignores) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` (titlebar, error boundaries, layout, session hydration) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/design/components/CommandPalette.tsx` (fuzzy search, recent files, command prefix routing) |
| Modify | All renderer IPC call sites (migrate to `window.api.*`) |

## Phase 2: Function

### 2A: Sidebar Filesystem Tree

Replace the flat file list with a hierarchical filesystem tree matching the vault's directory structure.

**File tree behavior**:
- Built client-side from flat file paths in `vault-store.files[]` (parse path segments into a tree structure via a `buildFileTree()` utility, no new IPC call needed)
- Collapsible folders with chevron indicators (right-pointing collapsed, down-pointing expanded)
- Item counts next to each folder name
- Vault root name with total file count at the top
- Active file highlighted with `accent.muted` background
- Each file item shows: artifact type color dot, truncated filename, relative timestamp
- Artifact type dot color derived from frontmatter `type` field or filename prefix

**Action bar** (top of sidebar, below search):
- New file button (triggers IPC to create on disk, watcher picks up change)
- New folder button
- Inline rename: click filename, it becomes an input field. Enter confirms, Escape cancels.
- Delete with confirmation dialog ("Delete budget.md? This cannot be undone.")
- Sort dropdown: Modified (default), Name, Type

**Search bar**: existing component, no changes in this phase.

**State management**:
- Collapse state: stored in a `useRef<Map<string, boolean>>` to survive re-renders from vault-store updates without triggering unnecessary re-renders itself. Persisted to state.json via VaultState.
- Sort preference: stored in vault-level config
- Tree architecture must not preclude drag-and-drop reordering in a future version. Use a flat data structure with `parentPath` references rather than deeply nested objects, so DnD reorder is a path update, not a tree restructure.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/sidebar/buildFileTree.ts` (flat paths to tree utility) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/sidebar/FileTree.tsx` (hierarchy, folders, counts, inline rename, delete) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx` (action bar, sort dropdown) |

### 2B: Graph Controls Panel

An Obsidian-style settings overlay for the graph, sliding in from the right edge of the center panel.

**Sections**:

**Filters**:
- Orphans toggle (show/hide disconnected nodes)
- Existing files only toggle (hide broken links)

**Groups** (collapsible):
- Maps to artifact type coloring configuration

**Display**:
- Node size slider (base radius)
- Link opacity slider
- Link thickness slider
- Arrows toggle (directional edges)
- Text fade threshold slider (zoom level at which labels appear)
- Animate button (toggles `simulation.alpha(1).restart()` vs `simulation.stop()`)

**Forces** (all sliders):
- Center force: maps to `d3.forceCenter()`
- Repel force: maps to `d3.forceManyBody().strength()`
- Link force: maps to `d3.forceLink().strength()`
- Link distance: maps to `d3.forceLink().distance()`

**Toggle behavior**: small icon in the top-right corner of the graph area opens/closes the panel. Panel overlays the graph, does not push content. The existing `GraphControls.tsx` pill toggle remains at top-center and is modified in Phase 3C to show Graph/Skills instead of Graph/Editor.

**Persistence**: all values stored in `graph-settings-store.ts` persisted to vault-level config via the IPC storage adapter from Phase 1.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphSettingsPanel.tsx` |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/store/graph-settings-store.ts` |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphPanel.tsx` (consume settings) |

### 2C: Terminal Tabs

Restyle the existing terminal tab bar to match the target design. Default terminal panel width is 400px (set in Phase 1 layout).

**Tab bar**:
- Active tab: elevated background (`bg.elevated`) + colored dot (green for shell, purple for Claude)
- Inactive tabs: muted text, dot still visible
- Close button (x) on each tab, hidden on the last remaining tab (behavioral change from current: close buttons on all tabs with no guard)
- "+" button to create a new session
- Tab naming: read process name from PTY (not string matching on the initial command, which is brittle for aliases like `npx claude` or `claude-code`). Fall back to shell name if PTY info unavailable.
- Manual tab rename: double-click tab name to edit inline

**Scrollback and search**:
- Scrollback buffer: 10,000 lines (configurable in settings). Prevents memory bloat from long agent sessions.
- In-terminal search: `Cmd+F` when terminal is focused opens a search bar within the terminal panel (xterm.js addon: `@xterm/addon-search`)

**Terminal zoom**: `Cmd+=` / `Cmd+-` when terminal is focused adjusts terminal font size independently of the app font size. Stored in terminal settings.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/terminal/TerminalPanel.tsx` (tab styling, close guard, rename, search, zoom) |
| Modify | `src/main/ipc/shell.ts` (expose PTY process name) |

### 2D: Basic Settings Modal

A tabbed modal opened from the titlebar settings gear.

**5 tabs**:

| Tab | Settings |
|-----|----------|
| Appearance | Theme (dark only for now, toggle infrastructure), font size, font family |
| Editor | Default edit mode (rich/source), autosave interval, spell check toggle |
| Graph | Default force/display values (reads/writes same store as GraphSettingsPanel) |
| Terminal | Default shell path, font size, scrollback buffer size |
| Vault | Vault path display, re-index button |

**Behavior**:
- Settings apply immediately on change (no save button)
- Escape key or backdrop click closes modal
- Persisted via IPC storage adapter (app-level settings to electron-store, vault-level to vault config)

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` (full implementation, replacing Phase 1 stub) |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/store/settings-store.ts` |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` (wire modal open from titlebar) |

## Phase 3: Interaction

### 3A: Node Selection with Neon Highlight

Three interaction layers on graph nodes:

**Idle state**:
- Nodes are small by default (base radius ~3-5px)
- All nodes have a faint ambient glow: pre-rendered to an offscreen canvas per artifact color (draw circle with shadowBlur once, cache as ImageBitmap). On each frame, `ctx.drawImage(glowSprite, ...)` instead of per-node `shadowBlur`. This scales to hundreds of nodes without GPU thrashing.
- Edges are dim, low opacity
- Constellation aesthetic

**Hover (transient)**:
- Mousing over a node triggers network reveal:
  - Hovered node: real-time `ctx.shadowBlur = 12-16` (only applied to this one node + neighbors, not the full graph)
  - Connected edges brighten to accent color (purple/violet), opacity ~0.7, slightly thicker
  - Connected neighbor nodes brighten with glow at their artifact type color (real-time shadowBlur for neighbors)
  - Non-connected nodes and edges dim to ~0.08-0.15 opacity
  - Labels appear on hovered node and its neighbors
- Mouse-leave: everything returns to idle state
- Transition in: 200ms ease-out. Transition out: 300ms ease-out (slower fade-out feels natural)

**Click (persistent)**:
- Same visual as hover but stays locked until clicking empty canvas or another node
- Useful for inspecting a neighborhood without holding the mouse still

**Right-click context menu** on nodes:
- Open in editor
- Reveal in sidebar (scroll file tree to this file)
- Copy file path
- Delete (with confirmation dialog)

**Double-click**:
- Opens the clicked node's file in the editor panel (transitions `contentView` to `'editor'`)

**Canvas2D implementation** (the graph uses `<canvas>` + `CanvasRenderingContext2D`, not SVG):
- Ambient glow: pre-rendered glow sprites per artifact color (offscreen canvas, cached). `drawImage` per node per frame.
- Hover/selected glow: real-time `ctx.shadowBlur = 12-16` on hovered node and its neighbors only (not the whole graph)
- Dimming: set `ctx.globalAlpha = 0.08` for non-connected nodes/edges, `1.0` for connected
- Edge brightening on hover: draw connected edges with artifact accent color at `globalAlpha = 0.7` and `lineWidth = 1.5`
- Selected node outer ring: draw a second `ctx.arc` at `r + 4` with `strokeStyle = accent` and low alpha
- Labels on hover: `ctx.fillText` for hovered node and connected neighbors
- `useGraphHighlight.ts` hook manages the hover/click/deselect state machine and computes the connected node/edge sets (adjacency list, built once on graph change, O(1) lookup per hover)

**`prefers-reduced-motion` in JS**: check `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')`. When set, disable glow transitions, skip node enter/exit animations, and reduce simulation alpha reheating. Nodes still highlight on hover but without animation.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/useGraphHighlight.ts` (hover/click state machine, adjacency list, connected set computation) |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphContextMenu.tsx` (right-click menu) |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/glowSprites.ts` (offscreen glow sprite cache) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphRenderer.ts` (glow sprites, dimming, edge brightening, label rendering) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphPanel.tsx` (event handlers, double-click, right-click, highlight integration) |

### 3B: Real-Time Graph Updates

When the agent writes a file via the terminal, the graph updates reactively.

**Data pipeline** (already partially exists):
1. Agent writes file to disk
2. Chokidar watcher (via `registerWatcherIpc`) detects the change
3. IPC sends file change event to renderer
4. `vault-store` updates `files[]`
5. `GraphPanel` diffs previous vs current file list

**Diff logic**: diff by file path as key. Detect adds, removes, and renames. Rename detection: when an `unlink` and `add` event occur within a 500ms window, the renderer reads the new file's content from `vault-store` (already loaded by the watcher pipeline) and compares its `artifact.id` to the removed file's `artifact.id`. If the IDs match, treat as a rename. This avoids content hashing entirely and uses the existing artifact identity system. A rename should animate as a position-preserving transition, not exit-old + enter-new.

**Batching**: rapid-fire file creation (agent writing 10 files in 2 seconds) is batched on a `requestAnimationFrame` cadence. Accumulate file change events, apply them as a single batch on the next animation frame, then restart the simulation once (not per-file).

**New node entry animation**:
- Opacity: 0 to 1 over 400ms
- Scale: 0.5 to 1 over 400ms
- Position: gentle drift from graph center
- D3 simulation: `alpha(0.3).restart()` (gentle re-settle, not full re-layout)

**Removed node exit**: fade out over 200ms, then removed from simulation.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/useGraphAnimation.ts` (enter/exit transitions, rename detection, rAF batching) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphPanel.tsx` (diff logic, animation integration) |

### 3C: Graph/Skills Toggle

Extends the center panel's content view to include a Skills lens.

**Content view states**: `'graph' | 'editor' | 'skills'`

**Toggle UI**: refactor existing `GraphControls.tsx` pill toggle from Graph/Editor to Graph/Skills. Active tab has `accent.muted` background. Editor is no longer in the pill toggle; it is accessed exclusively via node double-click in the graph or file selection in the sidebar.

**Skills view (minimal-functional, not placeholder)**: instead of a dead "coming soon" page, show the vault's `.claude/` commands and skills if they exist. Read the vault's `.claude/commands/` directory (if present) and display them as a list of available agent skills with name, description (from file comment header), and a "Run in Terminal" button that sends the command to the active terminal session. If no `.claude/` directory exists, show an empty state explaining how to add skills. This provides immediate value (the user can see and launch their Claude skills) while the full Skills experience is designed in a future spec.

**Keyboard shortcut changes**:
- `Cmd+G`: when in editor view, returns to graph view. When in graph view, switches to skills. When in skills, switches to graph. (Cycles graph > skills > graph, and always escapes editor back to graph.)
- The existing `onToggleView` handler in `useKeyboard` is updated to implement this cycle.
- **Command palette update**: the `BUILT_IN_COMMANDS` entry `cmd:toggle-view` (currently labeled "Toggle Graph/Editor" with `Cmd+G`) must be updated to "Cycle View" and its handler must call the new cycle logic, not the old binary toggle.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/skills/SkillsPanel.tsx` (reads .claude/commands, list UI, run button) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphControls.tsx` (Graph/Skills toggle, remove Editor button) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/store/graph-store.ts` (add `'skills'` to contentView union) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` (ContentArea renders SkillsPanel, update toggle logic, update command palette entry label) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/hooks/useKeyboard.ts` (updated Cmd+G cycle) |

### 3D: Enhanced Node Sizing

Node size is configurable via a mode selector in the Graph Settings Panel.

**Three modes**:

| Mode | Formula | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Degree (total) | `r = baseSize + Math.sqrt(degree) * scaleFactor` | Hub nodes larger, leaf nodes smaller |
| Uniform | `r = baseSize` | All nodes same size, color differentiates |
| Content length | `r = baseSize + Math.log(charCount / 100) * scaleFactor` | Larger files appear bigger (log scale prevents extremes) |

Degree is total degree (in-degree + out-degree). In a knowledge graph where backlinks and forward links are directional, total degree best represents a node's overall connectivity. The existing `connectionCount` field maps to this. If we later need in-degree or out-degree as separate sizing options, the graph data model already supports directional edges.

The "Node size" slider in the controls panel sets `baseSize`. The mode selector (dropdown) determines the scaling function. Default mode: degree. Default base size: small (3-5px range).

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/store/graph-settings-store.ts` (node size mode) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphRenderer.ts` (sizing logic) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphSettingsPanel.tsx` (mode dropdown) |

### 3E: Graph Performance and Virtualization

At 500+ nodes, Canvas2D with per-node effects will chug. This section establishes the performance strategy.

**Rendering budget**:
- Cull off-screen nodes: don't draw nodes outside the current viewport (check against transform + canvas bounds before drawing)
- Level of detail (LOD): at zoom levels where nodes are < 2px on screen, drop labels entirely and use simple `fillRect` instead of `arc` + glow. At extreme zoom-out, render edges as a single low-alpha overlay rather than individual lines.
- Frame budget target: 16ms (60fps). If a frame exceeds this, log a warning and reduce glow quality (skip ambient sprites, reduce shadowBlur resolution).

**Glow performance**: ambient glow uses pre-rendered sprites (see 3A). Real-time `shadowBlur` reserved for hovered node + neighbors only (typically < 20 nodes at once).

**WebGL fallback**: not implemented in V1, but the renderer interface is designed as a pluggable abstraction (`GraphRendererInterface` with `render()`, `hitTest()`, `resize()` methods) so a pixi.js or regl-based renderer can be swapped in later without changing GraphPanel or any store logic.

**Graph loading state**: first paint on a large vault shows a skeleton state while D3 force simulation stabilizes (1-3 seconds). A subtle pulsing dot cluster animation centered in the graph area, replaced by the real graph once simulation alpha drops below 0.1.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphRendererInterface.ts` (renderer abstraction) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphRenderer.ts` (implement interface, viewport culling, LOD) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphPanel.tsx` (loading state, renderer swap point) |

### 3F: Graph Minimap

Once zoomed into a cluster, spatial context is lost. A minimap restores it.

- Small inset canvas (120x80px) in the bottom-left corner of the graph area
- Renders the full graph at thumbnail scale (simple dots, no glow, no labels)
- Viewport rectangle overlay showing the current visible area
- Clicking the minimap pans the main graph to that location
- Toggle visibility in graph settings (Display section)

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphMinimap.tsx` |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphPanel.tsx` (minimap integration, pass transform state) |

## Phase 4: Polish

### 4A: Theme Coherence

Audit and unify all visual styling across every component.

**Actions**:
- Replace all hardcoded hex colors with token references from `tokens.ts`
- Panel dividers: replace hard 1px borders with subtle gradient separators (`bg.surface` to transparent)
- Standardize border-radius: 6px for containers, 4px for inline elements, 50% for dots/avatars
- All interactive elements get `bg.elevated` hover state with 150ms transition
- Focus rings: `accent.default` at 0.3 opacity, 2px offset, for keyboard navigation
- Scrollbar styling: thin, `bg.elevated` thumb, transparent track

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/design/tokens.ts` (border-radius constants) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/assets/index.css` (scrollbar styles, CSS custom properties) |
| Modify | All components with hardcoded colors (audit pass) |

### 4B: Typography System

Extend `tokens.ts` with a complete type scale.

**Display font (Inter)**:

| Role | Size | Weight | Color |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Page title | 20px | 600 | text.primary |
| Section heading | 15px | 600 | text.primary |
| Body | 13px | 400 | text.primary |
| Secondary | 12px | 400 | text.secondary |
| Label/caption | 12px | 400 | text.muted |

Labels use `text-transform: uppercase` and `letter-spacing: 0.05em`. Minimum text size floor: 12px for any text that isn't purely decorative (11px is unreadable on non-Retina). For non-Retina displays (`window.devicePixelRatio < 2`), the type scale shifts up 1px across the board.

**Mono font (JetBrains Mono)**:

| Role | Size |
|------|------|
| Terminal output, code blocks | 13px |
| Editor source mode | 12px |
| Inline code, file paths | 12px |

**Settings-driven**: font family and base size come from settings store. All other sizes are relative. Exposed as CSS custom properties (`--font-body`, `--text-sm`, etc.) for Tailwind consumption.

### 4C: Editor Toolbar and Features

New toolbar, breadcrumb, backlinks panel, and frontmatter handling for the editor.

**Breadcrumb** (`EditorBreadcrumb.tsx`):
- Back/forward navigation arrows
- File path: `folder / filename.md`
- Clicking a folder segment scrolls the sidebar file tree to that folder and expands it (dispatches a sidebar scroll-to action, not a stretch goal)

**Toolbar** (`EditorToolbar.tsx`):
- Undo / Redo
- Separator
- H1 / H2 / H3 / H4 heading toggles (H1 included; it is not reserved for title. If the user wants H1, they can use it.)
- Separator
- Bold / Italic / Strikethrough
- Separator
- Bullet list / Ordered list / Checkbox list
- Separator
- Code block / Link
- Right-aligned: Source mode toggle button

**Behavior**:
- Toolbar buttons map to Tiptap editor commands
- Active formatting reflected in button state (e.g., Bold highlighted when selection is bold)
- Toolbar hides when in source mode (CodeMirror has its own conventions)

**Frontmatter rendering**: if a file has YAML frontmatter, render it as a collapsible metadata header above the content (showing artifact type, tags, dates as styled key-value pairs). In source mode, show raw YAML. Toggle to expand/collapse the metadata header. Never show raw YAML in rich mode.

**Backlinks panel**: collapsible panel below the editor content showing all files that link to the current file. Each backlink entry shows: file title, the line containing the link (surrounding context, ~50 chars before and after), and artifact type dot. Clicking a backlink opens that file. Data source: a new `getBacklinks(id: string): Artifact[]` method on `VaultIndex` that builds a reverse lookup from the graph edges (iterate edges, collect sources where target matches the given id). This method does not exist today and must be added. Collapsed by default, toggle via a "Backlinks (N)" button in the editor footer.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/editor/EditorToolbar.tsx` |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/editor/EditorBreadcrumb.tsx` |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/editor/BacklinksPanel.tsx` |
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/editor/FrontmatterHeader.tsx` |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/editor/EditorPanel.tsx` (integrate toolbar, breadcrumb, frontmatter, backlinks) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/engine/indexer.ts` (add `getBacklinks(id)` reverse lookup method) |

### 4D: Enhanced Status Bar

Extract from inline in App.tsx to its own component with context-sensitive content.

**Left side** (always visible):
- Vault name
- Note count
- Git branch with status dot (green = clean, yellow = dirty)

**Right side** (context-sensitive):
- Editor mode: cursor position (Ln/Col), word count, encoding (UTF-8)
- Graph mode: node count, edge count, selected node name (if any)

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/components/StatusBar.tsx` |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` (replace inline StatusBar) |

### 4E: Transition and Animation Standards

All animations cataloged with consistent timing.

**Micro-interactions**:
- Hover states: 150ms ease-out
- Panel divider drag: immediate (no transition)
- Tooltip appear: 100ms ease-in
- Focus ring: 100ms ease-out

**Panel transitions**:
- Graph to Editor: zoom-to-node spatial transition (250ms). The graph zooms into the selected node until the node fills the content area, then crossfades to the editor over the last 100ms. This reinforces the "inspect" mental model: you're diving into a node, not switching tabs. Reverse: editor to graph zooms back out from the node's position.
- Settings panel slide: 250ms ease-out
- Modal overlay: 200ms fade-in
- Command palette: 150ms scale + fade

**Graph animations**:
- Node hover glow: 200ms ease-out
- Network reveal (hover): 200ms ease-out
- Network dim (mouse-leave): 300ms ease-out
- New node enter: 400ms fade + scale
- Node exit: 200ms fade

**Principles**:
- Never block interaction with animation
- Exit faster than enter
- No animations over 400ms
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: CSS animations via media query. Canvas2D/JS animations via `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')` check. When set: disable glow transitions, skip node enter/exit animations, reduce D3 simulation alpha reheating, instant state changes instead of animated ones.

**Implementation**: add `transitions` and `animations` sections to `tokens.ts` as named constants. Components reference these rather than inline timing values.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/design/tokens.ts` (transition/animation constants) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/assets/index.css` (prefers-reduced-motion media query) |

### 4F: Graph Keyboard Navigation

Accessibility and power-user keyboard navigation for the graph.

- `Tab` when graph is focused: select the first/next node (cycle through nodes in alphabetical order)
- `Shift+Tab`: select previous node
- `Arrow keys`: when a node is selected, traverse to connected neighbors (up/down for vertical, left/right for horizontal, based on spatial position)
- `Enter`: open selected node in editor (same as double-click)
- `Space`: toggle persistent selection (same as click)
- `Escape`: deselect current node
- Visual focus indicator: the same neon highlight used for hover, applied to the keyboard-focused node

The graph canvas receives focus via `tabIndex={0}` and a focus ring. All keyboard events handled in the `onKeyDown` handler of the canvas wrapper div.

**Files**:

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Create | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/useGraphKeyboard.ts` (keyboard navigation hook) |
| Modify | `src/renderer/src/panels/graph/GraphPanel.tsx` (keyboard handler integration, tabIndex, focus management) |
